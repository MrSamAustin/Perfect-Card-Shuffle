# Perfect-Card-Shuffle
How many perfect shuffles does it take for a deck to be in its original order?
For a regular deck of 52 cards (excluding jokers), a perfect shuffle is cutting the deck precisely in half and alternately shuffling the two halves together.
I.e. for the first half A1-A26 and the second half B1-B26, the first shuffle would look like A1,B1,A2,B2...A26,B26
After repeating this shuffle, the deck will eventually repeat. How many shuffles will it take?
